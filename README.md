Logo and Favicon
---

In the `#header` section of `stylesheets/application.css` you must change the link to the Freifunk-Logo:

    background: url('http://freifunk.in-kiel.de/images/ffki-logo.svg') no-repeat scroll 20px bottom / auto 100% transparent;

You should replace your the link to the logo with the one from your site or simply use one of these:
* https://www.google.de/search?q=freifunk.net+logo&tbm=isch

The default Redmine-Favicon is replaced by a new one simply generated by 

* http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-ico
* or http://www.RealFaviconGenerator.net

And place it in the folder `freifunk-red-andy/favicon/favicon.ico`

The favicon can also be used on other sub-sites, for example to use it in a wiki add the url to `mediawiki/LocalSettings.php`:

    $wgFavicon = 'http://freifunk.in-kiel.de/favicon.ico';

Or just copy it into each root folder of all sub-sites.
